    Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different personalities
in one and you will never be sure which one you will face. They are sociable,
communicative and ready for fun, with a tendency to suddenly get serious,
thoughtful and restless. They are fascinated with the world itself, extremely
curious, with a constant feeling that there is not enough time to experience
everything they want to see.
    The sign of Gemini belongs to the element of Air, accompanying Libra and
Aquarius, and this connects it to all aspects of the mind. It is ruled by
Mercury, the planet that represents communication, writing, and movement.
People born under this Sun sign often have a feeling that their other half
is missing, so they are forever seeking new friends, mentors, colleagues
and people to talk to.

    Gemini's changeable and open mind makes them excellent artists, especially
writers and journalists, and their skills and flexibility make them shine in
trade, driving and team sports. This is a versatile, inquisitive, fun loving
sign, born with a wish to experience everything there is out there, in the world.
This makes their character inspiring, and never boring.

    Gemini - the Caring Twins There is so much childish innocence in the nature
of Gemini, telling their tale of brotherhood, love between best friends and
relatives who are entirely different by character, circumstances, physical
appearance or upbringing. They are in this world to mend differences and make
them feel right, ready to give their life for a brother or a friend. Gemini Love
and Sex Fun and always ready for an intellectual challenge, Gemini sees love first
through communication and verbal contact, and find it as important as physical
contact with their partner. When these two combine, obstacles all seem to fade.
Inquisitive and always ready to flirt, a Gemini could spend a lot of time with
different lovers until they find the right one who is able to match their intellect
and energy. They need excitement, variety and passion, and when they find the right
person, a lover, a friend and someone to talk to combined into one, they will be
faithful and determined to always treasure their heart.</pre>
