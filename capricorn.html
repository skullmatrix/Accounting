    Capricorn is a sign that represents time and responsibility, and its
representatives are traditional and often very serious by nature. These
individuals possess an inner state of independence that enables significant
progress both in their personal and professional lives. They are masters of
self-control and have the ability to lead the way, make solid and realistic
plans, and manage many people who work for them at any time. They will learn
from their mistakes and get to the top based solely on their experience and
expertise.

    Belonging to the element of Earth , like Taurus and Virgo, this is the
last sign in the trio of practicality and grounding. Not only do they focus
on the material world, but they have the ability to use the most out of it.
Unfortunately, this element also makes them stiff and sometimes too stubborn
to move from one perspective or point in a relationship. They have a hard time
accepting differences of other people that are too far from their character,
and out of fear might try to impose their traditional values aggressively.

    Saturn is the ruling planet of Capricorn, and this planet represents
restrictions of all kinds. Its influence makes these people practical and
responsible, but also cold, distant and unforgiving, prone to the feeling of
guilt and turned to the past. They need to learn to forgive in order to make
their own life lighter and more positive.

    Capricorn – the Goat of Fear A goat with the tail of a fish is created to
face fear and create panic. It is the sign of decisions made to be protected
from monsters in our minds, lives, and immediate physical surrounding. Always
ready to transform into something that scares those scary things off, Capricorn
speaks of each natural chain reaction of fear, where one scary thing leads to many
others, rising up as defensive mechanisms that only make things worse. Immersed in
their secrecy, they face the world just as they are – brave enough to never run
away, but constantly afraid of their inner monsters.</pre>
