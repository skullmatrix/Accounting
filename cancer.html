    Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging
zodiac signs to get to know. They are very emotional and sensitive, and care
deeply about matters of the family and their home. Cancer is sympathetic and
attached to people they keep close. Those born with their Sun in Cancer are
very loyal and able to empathize with other people's pain and suffering.

    The sign of Cancer belongs to the element of Water, just like Scorpio and
Pisces. Guided by emotion and their heart, they could have a hard time blending
into the world around them. Being ruled by the Moon, phases of the lunar cycle
deepen their internal mysteries and create fleeting emotional patterns that
are beyond their control. As children, they don't have enough coping and
defensive mechanisms for the outer world, and have to be approached with care
and understanding, for that is what they give in return.

    Lack of patience or even love will manifest through mood swings later in
life, and even selfishness, self-pity or manipulation. They are quick to help
others, just as they are quick to avoid conflict, and rarely benefit from close
combat of any kind, always choosing to hit someone stronger, bigger, or more
powerful than they imagined. When at peace with their life choices, Cancer
representatives will be happy and content to be surrounded by a loving family
and harmony in their home.

    Cancer - the Brave Crab Sent to this Earth by something they believe in,
only to mess with someone bigger than they are, this isn't an animal aware of
their strength. Patriotism can make them endanger their own wellbeing, fighting
for someone else's cause, as if others can become their higher power. The Crab
knows where they're going, but this is often in a wrong direction, at least
until they learn their lessons and start relying solely on themselves.</pre>
