    People born under the sign of Leo are natural born leaders. They are
dramatic, creative, self-confident, dominant and extremely difficult to resist,
able to achieve anything they want to in any area of life they commit to. There
is a specific strength to a Leo and their "king of the jungle" status. Leo
often has many friends for they are generous and loyal. Self-confident and
attractive, this is a Sun sign capable of uniting different groups of people
and leading them as one towards a shared cause, and their healthy sense of
humor makes collaboration with other people even easier.

    Leo belongs to the element of Fire, just like Aries and Sagittarius. This
makes them warmhearted, in love with life, trying to laugh and have a good time.
Able to use their mind to solve even the most difficult problems, they will
easily take initiative in resolving various complicated situations. Ruled by
the Sun, Leo worships this fiery entity in the sky, quite literally as well as
metaphorically. They are in search for self-awareness and in constant growth of
ego. Aware of their desires and personality, they can easily ask for everything
they need, but could just as easily unconsciously neglect the needs of other
people in their chase for personal gain or status. When a Leo representative
becomes too fond and attached to their achievements and the way other people see
them, they become an easy target, ready to be taken down.

    Leo - the Lion in the Cave The story of the Lion always speaks of bravery.
This is an animal fearless and impossible to challenge, hurt or destroy, their
only weaknesses being fear and aggression towards those they confront. Living in
a cave, a Lion always needs to have one, nesting and finding comfort in hard times.
However, they should never stay there for long. With their head high, they have
to face others with dignity and respect, never raising a voice, a hand, or a weapon,
bravely walking through the forest they rule.</pre>
