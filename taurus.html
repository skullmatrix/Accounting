    Practical and well-grounded, Taurus is the sign that harvests the fruits
of labor. They feel the need to always be surrounded by love and beauty, turned
to the material world, hedonism, and physical pleasures. People born with their
Sun in Taurus are sensual and tactile, considering touch and taste the most
important of all senses. Stable and conservative, this is one of the most reliable
signs of the zodiac, ready to endure and stick to their choices until they reach
the point of personal satisfaction.

    Taurus is an Earth sign, just like Virgo and Capricorn, and has the ability
to see things from a grounded, practical and realistic perspective. They find
it easy to make money and stay on same projects for years, or until they are
completed. What we often see as stubbornness can be interpreted as commitment,
and their ability to complete tasks whatever it takes is uncanny. This makes
them excellent employees, great long-term friends and partners, always being
there for people they love. Earthly note makes them overprotective, conservative,
or materialistic at times, with views of the world founded on their love of
money and wealth.

    The ruler of Taurus is Venus, the planet of love, attraction, beauty,
satisfaction, creativity and gratitude. This tender nature will make Taurus
an excellent cook, gardener, lover, and artist. They are loyal and don't like
sudden changes, criticism or the chase of guilt people are often prone to, being
somewhat dependable on other people and emotions they seem to be unable to let
go of. Still, no matter their potential emotional challenge, these individuals
have the ability to bring a practical voice of reason in any chaotic and
unhealthy situation.

    Taurus â€“ the Wandering Bull Being the one who betrayed their best friend,
goddess Hera herself, this is an unfortunate being that has to wander the
Earth in order to find freedom. As if something was always poking them behind
their back, reminding them of happiness that once was, stinging and pushing
forwards, they close up in their own worlds, lonely and separated from their core.
To find love, a Taurus has to travel the world, change perspective or make a
shift in their entire belief system and their system of values.</pre>
