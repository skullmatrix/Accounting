    Scorpios are passionate and assertive people with determination and focus
you rarely see in other zodiac signs. They will turn to in-depth research to
reach the truth behind anything they find important. Great leaders and guides,
Scorpios are resourceful, dedicated and fearless when there is challenge to be
overcome. They will hold on to other people’s secrets, even when they aren’t
very fond of them to begin with and do anything they can for those they tie
themselves to.

    This is a Water sign, just as Cancer and Pisces, and its representatives
have to experience, express and face emotions. Always fighting dishonesty of any
kind, they have to learn not to manipulate or turn people to look their way by
methods that aren’t straightforward and clean. These inner tendencies sometimes
make them distrustful and jealous, suspicion leading them to strange behavioral
patterns they have to unveil.

    The rulers of Scorpio are Pluto and Mars, one of them being the planet of
transformation and regeneration, and the other pushing them forwards and providing
them with enough initiative to build their lives energetic and strong. These
individuals are known for being calm and cool, looking mysterious and hard to
figure out. There is a deep understanding of the rules of the Universe inside every
Scorpio that gives them the power others rush through life rarely recognizing within.

    Scorpio – the Deadly Warrior Sent by the goddess to kill someone, this is a sign
in search for their pray. Fearless and unstoppable, when they have a cause to fight
for, they will do it relentlessly and without paying attention to possible karmic or
other consequences. With deep self-awareness they discover ways to go around their
deepest, darkest motives, and shove their talents under the rug along with their
dark desires. They need to set free from taboos and restrictions, discovering
freedom to scream and fight for their beliefs in order to find peace and happiness.</pre>
