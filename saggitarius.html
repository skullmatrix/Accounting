    Curious and energetic, Sagittarius are the travelers of the zodiac. Their
open mind and philosophical view motivate them to wander around the world in
search of the meaning of life. Sagittarius is an extrovert, always optimistic,
full of enthusiasm, and ready for changes. This is a Sun sign of individuals
who are often preoccupied with mental work, but when they find grounding, they
show their ability to transform visions and thoughts into concrete actions and
circumstances.

    Just like Aries and Leo, Sagittarius is a Fire sign, in search of ways to
creatively color the world in their colors. Clear about their intentions and
honest by moral imperative, its representatives are often honest to the point
of absurd, with no regard for tact and emotions of other people whatsoever. It
is important for them to learn how to express their opinions in a tolerant and
socially acceptable way.

    Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, the largest planet of the Solar system and
the greatest beneficent giant in Astrology. Their enthusiasm has no boundaries,
and these people possess a great sense of humor accompanied by intense curiosity.
In need of absolute freedom, their adventurous spirit takes them from one end of
the world to the other, exploring different cultures and philosophies.

    Sagittarius â€“ the Misunderstood Healer Guided by the centaurs and the story 
of Chiron, Sagittarius is the sign of teaching and healing, always ready to
accommodate a friend and help others heal. This is a benefactor who is rarely
fully accepted by common people, always in search for great distances where they
might find a home. Pain is often hidden behind their smile, and they would gladly
give everything they have to other people only to live their lives free from it.
Blessed by many incredible things, there always seems to be something missing to
make their life complete.</pre>
