    Pisces are very friendly and often find themselves in company of very
different people. They are selfless and always willing to help others, a very
fine intent for as long as they don’t expect anything much in return. People
born with their Sun in Pisces have an intuitive understanding of the life cycle
and form incredible emotional relationship with other humans on the basis of
natural order and senses guiding them.

    The sign of Pisces is a Water sign, ending the cycle of Cancer and Scorpio,
being the one to disperse everything that happened in the past and change
anyone’s relative view on forgiveness. They are characterized by empathy and
incredible emotional capacity, but only if they keep their boundaries strong
and don’t let outer emotions overwhelm them.
    
    Ruling planets of the sign of Pisces and Neptune and Jupiter, and intuition
is the strongest suit of their kind. Connected to art, music, and any sort of
liberal expression, every Pisces representative has a talent they need to use
to feel creative and free. Tolerant and compassionate, they could do too much
for other people out of good intentions, forgetting about their own wellbeing
in the process.
    
    Pisces – the Loving Fish Imagine two people skinny dipping and suddenly
turning into two fish swimming around each other in a crystal-clean lake. This
is what the image behind Pisces should stand for, but it is more often connected
to the historical and mythological background as the follower of Capricorn. Fear
can drive them apart from loved ones, drive them into romance, or make them
tremble feeling completely unwilling and powerless. Still, love helps them swim
through the muddiest waters only to find the one their heart connects to. They
are not in search for just any love you think of, but for their soulmate, someone 
who connects with them with an umbilical cord, ready to exchange everything they
have with their Pisces partner throughout their entire shared lifetime and beyond.</pre>
