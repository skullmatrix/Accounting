    Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep
sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their
methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although
they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is
a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but
because they won’t accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when
opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature,
born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.

    Virgo is an Earth sign, fitting perfectly between Taurus and Capricorn.
This will lead to a strong character, but one that prefers conservative,
well-organized things and a lot of practicality in their everyday life.
These individuals have an organized life, and even when they let go to chaos,
their goals and dreams still have strictly defined borders in their mind.
Constantly worried that they missed a detail that will be impossible to fix,
they can get stuck in details, becoming overly critical and concerned about
matters that nobody else seems to care much about.

    Since Mercury is the ruling planet of this sign, its representatives have
a well-developed sense of speech and writing, as well as all other forms of
communication. Many Virgos may choose to pursue a career as writers, journalists,
and typists, but their need to serve others makes them feel good as caregivers,
on a clear mission to help.</pre>
