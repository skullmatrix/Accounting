    Aquarius is the sign different from the rest of the zodiac and people born
with their Sun in it feel special. This makes them eccentric and energetic in
their fight for freedom, or at times shy and quiet, afraid to express their true
personality. In both cases they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people
who love to fight for idealistic causes. They are able to see people without
prejudice and this makes them truly special. Although they can easily adapt to
the energy that surrounds them, Aquarius representatives have a deep need to
have some time alone and away from everything in order to restore power.

    The sign of Aquarius belongs to the element of Air, finishing the story of
Gemini and Libra and connecting them in a way through opposition of freedom and
relationships. They will rely on their mind and spoken words most of the time,
and without mental stimulation might lose interest even in the things that made
their heart jump at first. They see the world as a place full of possibilities
and have the need to be spontaneous, follow the moment, and live it to the
fullest in an attempt not to waste any time.

    Uranus is the ruler of Aquarius, shoulder to shoulder with its traditional
ruler – Saturn. Although Uranus has an abrupt, timid, and sometimes aggressive
nature, their other ruler often grounds them enough and helps them find enough
distance from other people to remain somewhat indifferent. A visionary and someone
ready for changes, an Aquarius is a known thinker and someone who will shake your
world once they are in it. They feel best as a part of a certain community, but
might have trouble finding just the right place where they feel they belong.

    Aquarius – the Pretty Protégé While Ganymede might have looked thin and weak,
this doesn't make character of these individuals any less powerful than it
obviously is. They always have someone to carry them up, someone to show them
the way towards the skies and the enlightenment they seek. Belonging to those
who are in charge, their problems with authority usually come out of their
relationship with other people, and not the leading structure itself. To find
center, they have to be ready to dig deep.</pre>
