    People born under the sign of Libra are peaceful, fair, and they hate
being alone. Partnership is very important for them, seeking someone with the
ability to be the mirror to themselves. These individuals are fascinated by
balance and symmetry, they are in a constant chase for justice and equality,
realizing through life that the only thing that should be truly important to
themselves in their own inner core of personality. This is someone ready to
do nearly anything to avoid conflict, keeping the peace whenever possible.

    The sign of Libra is an Air sign, set between Gemini and Aquarius, giving
these individuals constant mental stimuli, strong intellect and a keen mind.
They will be inspired by good books, insurmountable discussions and people who
have a lot to say. Each Libra representative has to be careful when talking to
other people, for when they are forced to decide about something that is coming
their way, or to choose sides, they suddenly realize that they might be in the
wrong place and surrounded by wrong people. No partner should make them forget
that they have their own opinion.

    Planet ruling the sign of Libra is Venus, making these people great lovers
but also fond of expensive, material things. Their lives need to be enriched
by music, art, and beautiful places they get a chance to visit.

    Libra – The Measure of Our Souls The shortest myth of them all seems to
present a good analogy to the shortest constellation in the sky, you might even
say that it is non-existent, presented by the pliers of Scorpio. Libra is one
dot of balance in the sea of different extremes, manifested only through the
fifteenth degree of this magnificent sign, an object among animals and people.
There is something awfully insecure about Libra, as if they were unsure which
plate to burden next, aware that things pass and teach us to be careful around
other people. Whatever we do in our lifetimes, only serves to point the way for
our Souls towards that “higher power” to finally measure our existence. Telling 
us where we went wrong or what we did right, Libras unconsciously teach us that
true liberation hides in lightness.</pre>
