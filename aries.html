    As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks
the beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They are continuously
looking for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first in
everything - from work to social gatherings. Thanks to its ruling planet
Mars and the fact it belongs to the element of Fire, Aries is one of the 
most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes
before they think about it.

    The Sun in such high dignity gives them excellent organizational skills,
so you'll rarely meet an Aries who isn't capable of finishing several
things at once, often before lunch break! Their challenges show when they
get impatient, aggressive and vent anger pointing it to other people.
Strong personalities born under this sign have a task to fight for their
goals, embracing togetherness and teamwork through this incarnation.

    Aries rules the head and leads with the head, often literally walking
head first, leaning forwards for speed and focus. Its representatives
are naturally brave and rarely afraid of trial and risk. They possess
youthful strength and energy, regardless of their age and quickly
perform any given tasks.

    Aries - the Flying Ram Guided by the story of the Golden Fleece,
an Aries is ready to be the hero of the day, fly away and carry many
endangered, powerless people on their back. The power of the ram is
carried on his back, for he is the gold itself, shiny and attractive to
those ready for betrayal. The story of glory that isn't easy to carry is
in these two horns, and if this animal doesn't get shorn, allowing change
and giving someone a warm sweater, they won't have much to receive from the world.
Each Aries has a task to share their position, power, gold, or physical strength
with other people willingly, or the energy will be stopped in its natural flow,
fear will take over, and the process of giving and receiving will hold
balance at zero.</pre>
